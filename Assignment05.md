Due 21 November 2017

The debates will be organized as follows:

Debate 1 (Nov 28): Lambda-CDM does not accurately describe structure on galactic scales
* 黄瑞 and 陈洋遥 versus 段晓苇 and 李洋
Debate 2 (Nov 28): AGN feedback is the main process that keeps massive galaxies quenched
* 张萌, 刘媛琪, and 丁骄 versus 王飞 and 姜金辰
Debate 3 (Dec 5): Galactic thick disk stars are primarily from accreted satellite galaxies
* 张春风 and 王凯翔 versus 王超 and 周星宇
Debate 4 (Dec 5): Halo mass is the main driver of galaxy evolution, and environment is secondary
* 王铂钧 and 盖逸飞 versus 张路路 and 朱锦平

Each debate will have one team debate the **affirmative** side, which supports the statement, and the other side debate the **negative**. The goal for the affirmative team is to convince the audience that the statement is true. 
The goal for the negative team is to convince the audience that the affirmative team has not made a strong enough argument to support the statement (this is different from proving that the statement is false!).

Which side each team will debate will be determined on the day of the debates.

The format of the debate is as follows:
* Affirmative opening statement (8 min). Introduce the topic and evidence for the statement.
* Cross-examination (questions, 2 min). The negative can ask the affirmative team questions.
* Negative opening statement (6 min).
* Cross-examination (questions, 2 min). The affirmative can ask the negative team questions.
* Affirmative rebuttal (5 min)
* Negative rebuttal (5 min)
* Open questions and debate (5 min)
* Audience votes for winner

Each team may use presentation slides, whiteboard, or any other tools to make their argument. Remember that it is not enough to simply state things, nor to simply say what others have said, but a good argument presents evidence.

**Due on Nov 21**

Each team should outline the key aruguments for the affirmative and negative for their topic. This can be done as a PPT or a written outline with references.

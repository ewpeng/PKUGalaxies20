# Final Project

One paragraph summary of proposal idea: Due on 4 January 2021 (by email to Kaixiang)

Final proposal due at 5pm, 12 January 2021 (by email to Kaixiang)

The goal of the final project is to write an observing, archival, or theory proposal that addresses an unanswered question in galaxies research. **This question should be one you learned about during your preparation for the debates.** Some examples:

* Observing propoals: You are free to propose to do new observations with any existing observing facility (whether or not you would actually have access to it at PKU). Example 1: 3 nights with Keck/DEIMOS to obtain multi-object optical spectroscopy of distant galaxies. Example 2: 60 nights on the Xinglong 2.16m to monitor AGN spectroscopic variability, combined with previously taken SDSS spectra of these AGN (combined archival + new observations)
* Archival/data science proposals: There is plenty of exisiting data from observatory archives (e.g., HST, ESO, Chandra, etc.) as well as from surveys (SDSS, DES, DECaLS, CFHTLS, etc.) that could be used to conduct new and interesting studies. You can write a proposal that describes a project one could do with any combination of these data.
* Simulations proposals: Much of our insight on galaxy formation is because of simulations. You may propose to use any exisiting simulation to investigate questions of interest (e.g., FIRE, IllustrisTNG, Bolshoi, Aquarius, etc.). You may also propose to produce a new simulation that is better than current ones in some respect.
* Theory proposals: Our theoretical understanding of physical processes underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution. You may also propose to work on a specific aspect of theory  (or theory combined with data) that will help answer some important questions.

The format of the proposal should be as follows (all text should use Times 12pt font, single spaced):

* Abstract (200 words) - This should be a summary of the entire proposal, written as if it is the only thing one would read.
* Scientific motivation (1 page of text, 12pt) - Introduction of the topic, science question(s) that will be addressed, and an explanation of why these questions are interesting and important. Please also review the literature of your chosen topic and explain what the current state-of-the-art is, and what can be improved.
* Experimental Design (1 page text) - The specific experiment you wish to conduct. If an observational proposal, what will you observe? If an archival/survey proposal, what data will you use? What is your sample and how is it selected and justified? If a simulations proposal, will you use exisiting simulations or produce new ones? How will these specific data, theory, or simulations answer the question(s) posed in the science justification? Most importantly, what will be *new* about your work that has not been done before?
* Figures and references (Up to 2 additional pages)

There will be a class on Tuesday, January 5 to discuss this final project. Everyione should have their one-paragraph summaries done before this class so we can discuss.

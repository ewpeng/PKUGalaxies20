1) **Debates**. In the final two weeks of class, we will have groups debate current topics in galaxy research. Teams will consist of two students each, and will choose their preferred topics to debate. Based on these preferences, we will match up groups with debate topics. Debate topics are actually statements that each side will support (affirmative) or not (negative). For this assignment, please form groups of two and select three topics that interest you. For each of these three topics, write **one paragraph** explaining why the topic is interesting, and what the current controversy is. This paragraph should be written in a way so that the person reading it would be interested in listening to the debate.

* Lambda-CDM does not accurately describe structure on galactic scales
* The origin of galactic thick disks is primarily due to the accretion of other galaxies
* The stellar initial mass function is not universal
  * [Conference proceedings from "The IMF@50"](http://arxiv.org/find/astro-ph/1/co:+AND+50+AND+at+AND+The+IMF/0/1/0/all/0/1)
  * Kroupa (2001, MNRAS, 322, 231)
  * Massey et al. (1995, ApJ,438,188)
  * Various papers by van Dokkum and Conroy (2010, 2011, 2012)
  * Cappellari et al. (2012, Nature, 484, 7395)

* Halo mass is the main driver of galaxy evolution, and environment is secondary
* AGN feedback is the main process that keeps massive galaxies quenched.
* Minor mergers are the primary mechanism for the size evolution of early-type galaxies since z=2.
